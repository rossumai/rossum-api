    """Tasks are used as status monitors of asynchronous operations.

    Tasks with succeeded status can redirect to the object created as a result of them.
    If ``no_redirect=true`` is passed as a query parameter, endpoint won't redirect to an object
    created, but will return information about the task itself instead.
